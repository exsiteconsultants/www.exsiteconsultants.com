              Alternatively, you know you need to build something but not sure
              how to organise your project or what technology to use. Exsite can
              advise on approaches and provide technical guidance with regards
              to what services to use or how to architect your application.

            <p>
              You might have an idea, but you're not a "techy". Exsite can
              create a prototype before you commit the time and money needed to
              build the real thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              A prototype can take the form of sketches, a slideshow or a very
              basic version of your service. Prototyping tests your ideas and
              allows you to put something in front of users early. Your users
              become part of the process instead of having a new application
              dumped on them at the end that doesn't take advantage of their
              experience or meet their needs.

            <p>
              You know what you want to build but need help building it. Exsite
              has experience developing solid reliable services that work,
              backed by tests and monitoring tools that let you know if your
              application needs attention before your users tell you.

              Exsite will help pick the best solution, using a reputable cloud

            <h2 class="card-title">Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
              This all sounds well and good but who are we? Exsite is a small
              consultancy based in the UK. We have experience building and
              running online services for a range of clients from small startups
              to government departments and UK mobile telecom operators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exsite has been building web applications since the web started;
              the first site was the very first travel website built around 1995
              for Thomson Holidays and not long after that we built the first
              website for
              <a href="https://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk">Hotel Chocolat</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2002/2002 Exsite was involved in the development of the first
              3G mobile messaging platform for Three UK and had the honour of
              sending the very first 3G email. Other notable work has included
              the creation of a prototype for a search-based Sky TV set top box
              which was built on a raspberry pi and demonstrated to the Sky
              board which lead to the development of search on all set top
              boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              More recent work has involved building services for government
              departments such as the Ministry of Justice, Department of
              International Trade and other branches of UK government. This work
              has included public facing services, internal tools and
              prototyping future ideas.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="card-content">
            <h2 class="card-title">Tools</h2>
            <p>
              For web-based applications Exsite primarily use React JS.
              Alternative frameworks such as Django are used for simple admin
              tools when React JS is overkill.
            </p>
            <p>
              For mobile applications Exsite uses
              <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> to build cross platform
              applications that work on both iOS and Android, though in some
              cases we use the native iOS & Android tools. Exsite is in the
              process of developing a prototype for the upcoming
              <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/"
                >Apple Vision Pro</a
              >
              platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              When the service needs to interact with a database, frameworks and
              languages including Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot) or NodeJS
              (Express) are brought in depending which is best suited to the
              problem. Database experience includes Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB.
              If none of these are the best choice for your project, we can
              adapt the solution to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes there are tried and tested solutions already available
              that can be adapted to your needs. Services such as
              <a href="https://www.wix.com/">WIX</a> or
              <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> can provide a
              complete ecommerce solution and we can help set them up and
              customise to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exsite has also been involved in researching and prototyping new
              technologies such as a project to create a proof of concept mixed
              reality application to asset engineers with helicopter gearbox
              maintenance.

              the charity adopt new technologies and ways of working. During
              this time Exsite developed an online service for social workers to
