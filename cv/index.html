					<dt class="section-title">Lead Front End Developer - Department for International Trade</dt>
					<dt class="time-period">Apr 2016 - Current</dd>
					<dd class="section-description">
						<p>
							I currently work in an agile team on a project within the Department for International Trade and Investment to replace an existing CRM platform with a new
							in house developed service. The new platform follows the GDS guidelines for style and layout, adapted to deliver a CRM. Development is user research 
							driven, with regular user testing sessions to gain feedback and help fine tune the design and user interaction.</p>
						<p>My primary role within this project is to deliver the web front end, though to start with I worked very closely with the user researcher and 
						   designer to create a near fully working prototype, using a combination of Postgresql, DJango Rest Framework and Node JS/Sass/Nunjucks. 
						   This prototype allowed rapid development of interface ideas and journeys. Once the requirements started to settle, back end developers 
						   were brought in to deliver integration with the existing back end and I have focussed on creating the front end screens, flow and components.
						</p>
						<p>As lead front end developer I have also be responsible for setting standards and looking at common themes across project and focused on the creation of a front end 
						toolkit to avoid duplication of work and a consistant user experience. Furthermore I have been providing consultancy and advise on the hiring of other front end developers

					<dt class="section-title">Full Stack Developer - <a href="https://www.complete-deputy-report.service.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a></dt>
					<dd class="time-period">Mar 2015 - Apr 2016</dd>
					<dd class="section-description">
						<p>I worked at the Ministry of Justice in the Office of the Public Guardian developing a 
							<a href="https://www.complete-deputy-report.service.gov.uk/">'Digital deputy' service</a>. The service is 
							designed for members of the public responsible for the finances and welfare of people who have lost the mental capacity to 
							manage their own affairs or make important decisions. My primary role was to develop the frontend of the service inline with styles and 
							guidelines laid down by GDS and work with the GDS community.
						</p>	
						<p>The service used PHP and Symfony 2 for it's server side framework and the frontend used TWIG to generate HTML pages, with styles authored in SASS and 
							extended the GDS Elements project.
							The site is accessable for users of differing levels of technical and physical ability and works on all devices, ranging from people with very old 
							computers to the latest mobile devices. The site uses progressive enhancement 
							to improve the experience for devices capable of supporting it, including features such as autosave and real time validation. The focus on the site 
							is to make it as easy to use and as clear as possible. As part of the project I extracted the controls created for it and started to develop a 
							standalone project to make them reusable.
						</p>
						<p>Javascript components were developed following TDD with 
							tests written in Mocha JS, Integration testing was developed in BEHAT with cross browser testing automated and integrated with Browserstack. The service was 
							developed and deployed using Docker containers to make it easy to develop the platform anywhere and provide predictable deployment.
						</p>
						<p>The project was developed following the GDS principles for service delivery, being user research driven and created by a small tight knit team. I worked 
							on the project from early in the Alpha stage and ultimately through a public Beta assessment and learned a lot from that.</p>

					<dd class="time-period">Jan 2010 - Mar 2015</dd>
					<dd class="section-description">
						<p>I Joined the Sky Search team as a front end developer working primarily with HTML/Javascript/CSS in an agile environment. During my time 
						at Sky I was responsible for the development of many projects, starting with a redevelopment of search for the Sky help website, and improvement of all of Sky's web 
						based search services.</p>
						
						<p>As part of a Sky wide project to make their sites more responsive, and the introduction of a new search backend, I was 
						asked to re-write the search sites so that they could integrate with a new backend and provide support for a wide range of devices, from mobile up to desktop.
						I developed the new system with a NodeJS backend, which allowed fast flexible development and is capable of handling very high volumes of traffic in a 
						fault tolerant configuration.</p>
						
						<p>Some applications I developed were single page web applications, whilst others followed a more traditional route, depending on their needs. I 
						also developed other prototypes and proof of concept applications including a fully working mockup of 'set top box search' to gain buy in from the business 
						and an iPad prototype to demonstrate future search capabilities.</p>
					
						<p>During development of these systems I setup automated testing using MochaJS for unit testing and Cucumber/Webdriver for integration and cross browser testing.</p>
					
						<p>In my last project at Sky I worked as part of a team that delivered a new Search API for use with Sky's upcoming 'Q' box. This is a complex Java/Jersey 
							server application that ingests program information into Mongo and Solr and then allows access to that via a JSON api. This service had to scale to millions 
							of users and serve thousands of transactions a second within a very short time, so as not to impact users experience on their TV.</p>
