      <div class="introduction"><p>Exsite worked at the Ministry of Justice in the Office of the Public Guardian developing a ‘Digital deputy’ service. The service is designed for members of the public responsible for the finances and welfare of people who have lost the mental capacity to manage their own affairs or make important decisions. My primary role was to develop the frontend of the service inline with styles and guidelines laid down by GDS and work with the GDS community.</p>
<p>The service used PHP and Symfony 2 for it’s server side framework and the frontend used TWIG to generate HTML pages, with styles authored in SASS and extended the GDS Elements project. The site is accessable for users of differing levels of technical and physical ability and works on all devices, ranging from people with very old computers to the latest mobile devices. The site uses progressive enhancement to improve the experience for devices capable of supporting it, including features such as autosave and real time validation. The focus on the site is to make it as easy to use and as clear as possible. As part of the project I extracted the controls created for it and started to develop a standalone project to make them reusable.</p>
<p>Javascript components were developed following TDD with tests written in Mocha JS, Integration testing was developed in BEHAT with cross browser testing automated and integrated with Browserstack. The service was developed and deployed using Docker containers to make it easy to develop the platform anywhere and provide predictable deployment.</p>
<p>The project was developed following the GDS principles for service delivery, being user research driven and created by a small tight knit team. I worked on the project from early in the Alpha stage and ultimately through a public Beta assessment and learned a lot from that.</p>
